        <h1><img src="/images/wow.png" alt="World of Warcraft" />Welcome to Sons of Anarchy guild.</h1>
        <p>
            Over the last decades Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPG) became increasingly popular,
            with World of War-craft (WoW), the leading game in the genre, exceeding nine million subscribers worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
            This guild is seeking mature experienced players who want to keep the game interesting by socialising
            with other players.
        </p>
        <p>
            My name is Borca (Toon name that is &#9786;) and I was wondering if you would like to take
            a long journey through the realm of Dreadmaul with me raiding and killing foes (enemy players).
        </p>
        <p>
            Due to work commitments I don't intend to have a hard core team aiming to be the best in nine million,
            but I'm going to have fun playing casually and enjoying socialising, which I'm sure is what a game like
            wow is intended for. . .
        </p>
